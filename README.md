This is an old project where I was trying to write a python wrapper for the wonderful uvcdynctrl 
library by Logitech.  I tried some crazy nonesense and it never worked as I had originally hoped.

That said, I still wanted to keep some of this code around in case it might inspire me to work with it again someday.
